Delightful display
Snowdrops bow their pure white heads
To the sun's glory.

Like crunchy cornflakes
Gold leaves rustle underfoot
Beauty in decay.

The chill, worming in
Shock, pleasure, bursting within
Summer tongue awakes

You and me alone
Madness of world locked away
Peace and quiet reigns

Strokes of affection
Light and tenderly expressed
Keep loveâ€™s bonds so strong.

Calm as a river
Tranquility in my heart
Blue summer skies reign.

Mellow, mild, May day,
calling children out to play.
Summer's on her way!

Beautiful sunrise
On a warm summer morning.
I wait for day's start.

I was in fire,
The room was dark and somber.
I sleep peacefully.

Coolness fills the air
Scarves and sweaters everywhere
Fall weather is here
